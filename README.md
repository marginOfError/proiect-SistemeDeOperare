# proiect-SistemeDeOperare
A project I made back in my first year of college. It's not optimized to work at its best but it's a nice, little project that I'm proud of because it was my first real project involving coding in a programming language.
Also, I didn't do it from scratch. I copied some pieces of code from a youtube video tutorial that was about creating a similar console game involving cars and a race.
